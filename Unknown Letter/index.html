      <h1>Dear Shoon,</h1>
	  <br>
      <p>I may find thousands of ways to confess love to you because there are thousands of them around the world. But there is only one thing I can do to prove that I love you, and that is by actions. I’ll do whatever it takes to prove my love to you, darling. I hope that you can feel how much I love you.</p>
	  <p>When I first saw you, I felt scared to talk to you. I love you without really knowing why, when, or where it started. My love for you is simple and honest, without any complications or ego. I love you simply because I don't know any other way to love.</p>
	  <p>I choose you. And I’ll choose you over and over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat. I’ll keep choosing you.</p>
	  <p>I love you and I don’t want to lose you. Because my life has been better since the day I found out.</p>
	  <p>I have died everyday waiting for you darling, don’t be afraid I have loved you for a thousand years, I’ll love you for a thousand more.</p>
	  <br>
